# Michael Bianco Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a data analyst professional with a financial industry background seeking to apply and grow my technical skillset. I have experience in SQL Server, Power BI, Excel, Python, Alteryx, VBA and statistical concepts. A self-starter, I have leveraged my skills to create practical tools for myself and my colleagues to assist outside of my position's responsibilities. My client-facing experiences highlight my relationship management skills to define and guide business needs.
	
My projects aim to demonstrate my knowledge and skills for necessary analytical tools and concepts. There are more projects in development and this page will be updated as they are completed. Thank you for your time!
