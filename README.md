### Grey Poupon Lyrics Analysis
**Code:** Grey Poupon Lyrics Analysis

**Goal:** Perform analysis on songs mentioning Grey Poupon in their lyrics to uncover insights and linguistic trends

**Description:** Grey Poupon, a brand of Dijon mustard, is used frequently in Hip Hop music as an allegory for status, luxury and class [1]. To provide further insight into its use within the music genre, data is scraped and cleaned from a variety of web sources to perform analysis to illustrate hidden patterns related to its use. The combined dataset consists of song titles, artist names, lyric snippets and word categories (i.e. nouns, verbs, etc.).

**Skills:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, linguistic analysis, exploratory analysis, web scraping, data visualization

**Technology** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, TextBlob, pyautogui, Jupyter Notebooks

**Results** Scraped multiple web sources to extract, clean and organize music data for analysis. Conclusions included total songs found that reference the mustard brand, most common nouns and verbs in the lyric snippets, alternative spellings of "grey" and "poupon" and count of words that rhyme with "poupon" (among others). Visualizations were created to accompany most of the conclusions presented.
